Base Stylesheet
===============

Base Stylesheet uses [Eric Meyer's reset.css](http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/) and then extends it to add typography, as well as other basic margins/paddings. The typography uses rems to make it easier to bump the font-size up or down, which is useful for responsive stuff. The example HTML I pulled from to create these base stylesheet was from the [Barebones Styleguide](http://barebones.paulrobertlloyd.com/).

Getting Started
---------------

1. Download [base.min.css](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tylerchilds/base-stylesheet/master/base.min.css)
2. Add `<link rel="stylesheet" href="base.min.css">` to your html. There's no need to add a reset stylesheet, this includes the reset styles.
